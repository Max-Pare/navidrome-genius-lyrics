# navidrome-genius-lyrics

This simple tampermonkey script changes Navidrome's semi-useless lyrics button to a simple Genius.com search to find the lyrics to the song that is currently playing.
I made this in 15 minutes, but the worst that can happen is that it doesn't work.

# You need to change the script's "@match" property to point to your actual Navidrome server, otherwise this will not work at all.
